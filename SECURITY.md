Please include the following information:

- **Type of vulnerability** (e.g., buffer overflow, SQL injection, XSS, etc.)
- **Full paths of source file(s)** related to the vulnerability
- **Location of the affected source code** (tag/branch/commit or direct URL)
- **Step-by-step instructions to reproduce** the issue
- **Proof-of-concept or exploit code** (if possible)
- **Impact of the issue**, including how an attacker might exploit it

### ⏱️ Response Timeline

### 🛡️ Security Update Process

1. **Acknowledgment**: We'll acknowledge receipt of your vulnerability report
2. **Investigation**: We'll investigate and assess the severity
3. **Fix Development**: We'll develop a fix (with your help if desired)
4. **Notification**: We'll notify you when the fix is ready
5. **Release**: We'll release a security update

### 🔐 Security Best Practices

When using zorvia:

1. **Keep Updated**: Always use the latest version
2. **Least Privilege**: Run with minimum required permissions
3. **Review Configs**: Validate VM configurations before applying
4. **Audit Logs**: Monitor zorvia operations in production
5. **Secure Credentials**: Never commit credentials or secrets to git
6. **Network Security**: Use appropriate network policies in Kubernetes

### 🚨 Known Security Considerations

#### Kubernetes Access
- zorvia requires access to Kubernetes API
- Use appropriate RBAC policies to limit access
- Review and restrict service account permissions

#### Configuration Files
- Configuration files may contain sensitive data
- Use `.gitignore` to exclude sensitive configs
- Never commit cloud-init user-data with passwords

#### Container Images
- Container disk images are pulled from registries
- Verify image sources and use trusted registries
- Consider using private registries for production

#### Cloud-Init
- Cloud-init user-data can execute arbitrary code in VMs
- Review cloud-init scripts before deployment
- Avoid hardcoded credentials in cloud-init
