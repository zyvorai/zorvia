# Social assets

Rebuildable cards for README, docs Open Graph, and LinkedIn/X. Story matches the README “What you get” five-step strip (Create → Day-2 → Access → Guard → Audit).

## Palette

apple.com blue and white: white → `#f5f5f7` background with a faint blue wash, ink `#1d1d1f`, secondary `#6e6e73`,
hairline `#d2d2d7`, blue `#0071e3` → `#2997ff`. Dark card: `#000` / `#0b0b0f`, text `#f5f5f7`, cards `#1d1d1f`,
blue `#0a84ff` / `#2997ff`. Type is Helvetica Neue with Menlo for labels. Orange `#ff6a2a` appears exactly once per
image, as the small dot on the Create step; the Zyvor mark is drawn inline in blue.

## Rebuild

```bash
./docs/social/build-social-cards.sh
```

Needs Google Chrome and macOS `sips` (override the browser with `CHROME=/path/to/chrome`). The script renders all
outputs above and the comparison cards below.

## GitHub social preview

The repository's **Social preview** image (Settings → Social preview) cannot be set through the API or `gh`;
upload `zorvia-share-card.png` there by hand after it changes.

Licence wording follows `LICENSE` (Apache-2.0). The version chip tracks `Cargo.toml` (currently 0.4.0) and the
CHANGELOG.

## OpenShift vs Zorvia vs ZeusOS cards

Four concepts, each in 1600x900 (LinkedIn/X, JPG), 1200x630 (OG/README, PNG) and 1080x1080 (square, PNG), light and
dark, in `compare/`. Sources: `compare-lanes.html` (hero: "Pick your control plane"), `compare-scorecard.html`,
`compare-poster.html`, `compare-migration.html` (Transiva > h2kvm > GuestKit > Zorvia, Community vs Enterprise), sharing `compare.css` and `compare.js`. Size and theme come from the URL hash, for example
`compare-lanes.html#1200x630-dark`. `./docs/social/build-social-cards.sh` renders all 24.

Every Zorvia row must trace to [FEATURE_MATURITY.md](../FEATURE_MATURITY.md) and OpenShift rows to [leave-openshift.md](../leave-openshift.md).
ZeusOS cells are vendor-stated (https://zyvor.dev/zeus-os; editions and pricing are not public, so say "ask"). Migration-card facts come from the
Transiva and h2kvm `docs/ce-vs-enterprise.md` files. The comment at the top of each card lists its sources. Re-check the "as of" date in the footer and the ZeusOS rows before each new campaign.
ZeusOS is a separate proprietary product, not Zorvia commercial support.

### Alt text

- **lanes**: Three columns comparing OpenShift (Red Hat subscription, OpenShift only, Red Hat support, Advanced Cluster Management), Zorvia (open source Apache-2.0, any KubeVirt cluster, CLI, TUI and web, multi-cluster Experimental, VMware migration through the separate Transiva and h2kvm suite) and ZeusOS (proprietary commercial, web and TUI, approval-gated changes, Migration Factory, multi-cluster in paid editions). Headline: Same KubeVirt VMs. Pick your control plane.
- **scorecard**: A table with nine rows comparing OpenShift, Zorvia and ZeusOS, marked yes, partial or no. OpenShift leads on support contract, multi-cluster and integrated VMware migration; Zorvia leads on licence cost, running on any KubeVirt cluster, TUI and built-in drift gating, with multi-cluster still Experimental.
- **poster**: Leave the subscription. Keep the VMs. Three cards: OpenShift for Red Hat contract and certified operators, Zorvia open source, ZeusOS proprietary commercial.
- **migration**: Leaving VMware, four tools one path. Transiva exports (Apache-2.0; Enterprise adds CBT, waves and 10+ providers), h2kvm converts and deploys to KubeVirt (production licence; Enterprise adds HA operator, Windows and SAN/Ceph runbooks), GuestKit scores boot readiness (Apache-2.0), Zorvia operates day 2. Zorvia's own importer is Experimental.

**LinkedIn, migration** (use `compare/migration-1600x900.jpg`)

> Leaving VMware for KubeVirt? Export with Transiva, convert with h2kvm, assure with GuestKit, operate on Zorvia. Four tools, each with a free community tier; h2kvm needs a paid licence in production, and Zorvia's own importer is still Experimental. github.com/zyvorai/zorvia #KubeVirt #VMware
