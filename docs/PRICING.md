# Pricing

> **Proposed launch prices. Not approved.** Every figure on this page is a proposal, subject to commercial approval and validation against delivery cost. Nothing here is an offer, and no billing, payment collection or entitlement enforcement exists in the product. Final terms are in your signed order form.

## The software stays free

Zorvia is Apache-2.0. You may use, modify and run it in production, commercially, at no charge. Paying customers pay for **services around the software**: production support, deployment, migration, training and managed operations. Support is a paid service contract, not a software licence, and nothing in the product checks for one.

An expired or missing contract never stops VMs or disables existing community functionality ([COMMERCIAL_OFFERINGS.md](COMMERCIAL_OFFERINGS.md)).

## India (INR, excluding taxes)

| Offering | Proposed price | Billing period | Included services |
|---|---:|---|---|
| Community | Free | n/a | Software, documentation, community support |
| Supported | ₹30,000 per worker node; ₹1.5 lakh annual minimum | Per year | Business-hours Zorvia troubleshooting and upgrade guidance |
| Supported Plus | ₹60,000 per worker node; ₹4 lakh annual minimum | Per year | Supported, plus priority handling, quarterly health reviews, planned Zorvia upgrade assistance |
| Managed | From ₹50,000 per cluster | Per month | Support, monitoring, maintenance and operational tasks defined in the contract |
| Deployment | ₹1–3 lakh per project | One-time | Installation, agreed integrations, validation, handover |
| Migration | From ₹2 lakh per project | Per project | Assessment, pilot, migration waves, validation |
| Training | ₹40,000 per workshop | Per workshop | One remote administrator workshop and operational runbooks |

## International (USD, excluding taxes)

These are independently proposed regional prices, **not currency conversions** of the India table.

| Offering | Proposed starting price | Billing period |
|---|---:|---|
| Supported | $600 per worker node; $3,000 annual minimum | Per year |
| Supported Plus | $1,200 per worker node; $8,000 annual minimum | Per year |
| Managed | $1,500 per cluster | Per month |
| Deployment | $3,000 per project | One-time |
| Migration | $5,000 per project | Per project |
| Training | Custom quote | n/a |

## What is not included

Hardware, infrastructure hosting, third-party subscriptions, travel and applicable taxes are additional. So is any service listed as "separately scoped" in [SUPPORT_SCOPE.md](SUPPORT_SCOPE.md).

## Billing rules

- **Billable node:** a Kubernetes worker node covered by the contract.
- **Order form:** lists the covered clusters and nodes.
- **Node treatment:** the order form states explicitly how mixed-role nodes, temporary nodes and capacity changes are treated. Nothing is assumed.
- **Annual support price:** the **greater of** (worker nodes × per-node price) and the annual minimum.
- **Mid-term additions:** follow the proration policy written in the order form. No default policy is assumed on this page.
- **Managed:** quoted by node count, VM count, supported components and operational workload. Managed pricing **includes** the contracted support for the same coverage, so do not add a second Supported subscription for it.
- **Activation:** a paid service is activated only after explicit customer acceptance.
- **Expiry:** ends the service; never stops VMs.

### Minimum-contract check

| Worker nodes | Supported (India) | Supported Plus (India) | Supported (USD) | Supported Plus (USD) |
|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| 3 | ₹1.5 lakh (minimum) | ₹4 lakh (minimum) | $3,000 (minimum) | $8,000 (minimum) |
| 5 | ₹1.5 lakh (= 5 × ₹30,000) | ₹4 lakh (minimum) | $3,000 (= 5 × $600) | $8,000 (minimum) |
| 8 | ₹2.4 lakh | ₹4.8 lakh | $4,800 | $9,600 |
| 12 | ₹3.6 lakh | ₹7.2 lakh | $7,200 | $14,400 |

The node-based price first exceeds the minimum above 5 nodes for Supported and above 6 nodes for Supported Plus (6 × ₹60,000 = ₹3.6 lakh, still under ₹4 lakh; 7 × ₹60,000 = ₹4.2 lakh).

## Example: three-node deployment (India)

| Item | Amount |
|---|---:|
| Deployment | ₹1 lakh |
| Supported annual subscription (3 × ₹30,000 = ₹90,000, below the minimum) | ₹1.5 lakh |
| **First-year total** | **₹2.5 lakh** |
| Annual support renewal | ₹1.5 lakh |

Applicable taxes and separately scoped services are additional. Renewal assumes unchanged scope and pricing.

## Maturity

Only **GA** and documented **Beta** features are sold as production services. Deployment and migration engagements do not commit to Experimental capabilities (for example the plan-only Transiva hook). See [FEATURE_MATURITY.md](FEATURE_MATURITY.md).
