# Leaving OpenShift Virtualization

OpenShift Virtualization runs KubeVirt. Its VMs are ordinary KubeVirt `VirtualMachine` objects. So moving off OpenShift's control plane does not mean rewriting your VMs. It means choosing a different platform around the same objects.

Zorvia, and its commercial Enterprise edition, are one way to do that. This page compares them with OpenShift, including where OpenShift is the better choice.

> Every Zorvia "Yes" below maps to a feature in [FEATURE_MATURITY.md](FEATURE_MATURITY.md). Only **GA** and **Beta** items are production promises. Anything **Experimental** is labelled as such.

## Two editions

| | **Zorvia** | **Zorvia Enterprise** |
|---|---|---|
| Licence | Apache-2.0, free for production | Commercial, licensed separately |
| Best for | Teams that run KubeVirt themselves and want a real control plane without a subscription | Teams that need production support and SLAs they can put in a contract |
| Surfaces | CLI, TUI, web console, one Fabric API | Same |
| Support | Community (GitHub issues) | Production support and SLAs |
| Start | [Quick start](../README.md#quick-start) | [sales@zyvor.dev](mailto:sales@zyvor.dev) |

**Start with Zorvia** to prove the model against your own cluster at no cost. **Take Zorvia Enterprise** when you need support you can put in a contract. Tell sales your cluster size and what you need, and they will say what is included today.

ZeusOS is a separate Zyvor product. It is proprietary (not open source) and is not the enterprise edition of Zorvia. See [zyvor.dev/zeus-os](https://zyvor.dev/zeus-os) if you want to look at it.

## Honest comparison

| Capability | OpenShift Virtualization | Zorvia | Zorvia Enterprise |
|---|---|---|---|
| VM create and day-2 without hand-written YAML | Yes | Yes (`vm-lifecycle`, GA) | Same as Zorvia |
| Live migration between nodes | Yes | Yes (`live-migration`, GA; needs shared storage) | Same as Zorvia |
| Snapshots and restore | Yes | Yes (`snapshots-restore`, GA) | Same as Zorvia |
| Web console with VNC and serial | Yes | Yes (`web-console`, GA) | Same as Zorvia |
| Terminal UI | No | Yes | Same as Zorvia |
| Audit trail with export | Cluster audit log | Yes (`audit-trail`, GA, JSONL export) | Same as Zorvia |
| SSO | Built-in OAuth server | OIDC (`oidc`, Beta) | Same as Zorvia |
| Drift detection and change-plan gating | No | Yes (`zorvia change drift` / `zorvia change plan`) | Same as Zorvia |
| Runs on any KubeVirt cluster | No, OpenShift only | Yes | Same as Zorvia |
| Licence cost | Red Hat subscription | $0 | Commercial licence |
| Vendor support contract | Yes (Red Hat) | No, community | Yes (production support and SLAs) |
| Multi-cluster management | Yes (Advanced Cluster Management) | Experimental (`fleet-multicluster`, inventory stub) | Ask sales |
| VM migration from VMware | Yes (Migration Toolkit for Virtualization) | Experimental (`transiva-migration`, plan only) | Ask sales |
| Operator lifecycle and certified ecosystem | Yes (OLM, certified operators) | No | No |
| Telco-grade networking (SR-IOV, NFV, encrypted mesh) | Mature | Experimental (`gpu-sriov-numa`, plan only) | Ask sales |

## Choose OpenShift when

- You need a Red Hat support contract or certified-stack requirement written into a procurement rule.
- You already run OpenShift for containers and want one platform, one vendor.
- You depend on operators from the certified catalogue, or on telco-grade networking today.
- You need cluster-to-cluster VM migration tooling that is already GA.

## Choose Zorvia when

- You want KubeVirt without a per-node subscription and are happy to run it yourself.
- You want the same actions from a terminal, a TUI and a browser.
- You want drift and change-plan checks before a change ships.

## Choose Zorvia Enterprise when

- You want the same KubeVirt-native approach with a vendor behind it.
- You need production support and SLAs in a contract.
- You have multi-cluster or migration needs. Ask sales what is covered today; the Experimental items in the table above are not promises.

## What does not change

Your `VirtualMachine`, `DataVolume` and `PersistentVolumeClaim` objects stay as they are. The [adoption runbook](adopt-existing-kubevirt-cluster.md) shows how to point Zorvia at an existing KubeVirt cluster, read-only first.

## What is not done yet

- Zorvia has no production VM importer. Transiva (VMware to KubeVirt) is Experimental and plan-only. Do not plan a migration around it.
- Running Zorvia on OpenShift itself has not been verified. See the runbook for what to check.
- Format conversion (VMDK, VHD to qcow2) is not shipped.

## Cost

Red Hat does not publish a list price for OpenShift Virtualization. It states that OpenShift Virtualization Engine is licensed per bare-metal node ([Red Hat](https://www.redhat.com/en/technologies/cloud-computing/openshift/virtualization-engine)). Put your own quote against the licence line above. A calculator that takes your figure, and assumes none, is planned.
